# ML.NET for Wine Collection API Creation

This is the work that I did based off a Youtube Tutorial to understand how to create an API using Azure, ML.NET and Regression Models. Further, I also plan to add it as my second project in my Github gist related to ML.NET. I did this project to better understand ML.NET and implement the same in Unity (which uses C#). Later, we decided to use the ML-Agents library for the same.
